    <h1>about kana run</h1>
    <a href="./index.html">back to game</a>
    <h2>what is this?</h2>
    <p>kana run is a dead simple website that displays random kana characters/sequences, and the goal is to type them as quickly as possible.
        it's a game of focus designed to help you remember and read Japanese faster.</p>
    <h2>how to play</h2>
    <p>kana run is designed to use a Japanese IME on a typical US english keyboard, see the following articles for your OS to enable one:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-japanese-ime-da40471d-6b91-4042-ae8b-713a96476916">Microsoft Windows</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/japanese-input-method/set-up-the-input-source-jpim10267/mac">macOS</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-is/guide/iphone/iph73b71eb/ios">iOS/iPadOS</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/gboard/answer/6380730?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#zippy=%2Cchoose-languages-layouts">Android (GBoard)</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1059492">ChromeOS</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>for linux distributions, please refer to your distribution's documentation for installing a Japanese-capable IME, such as Mozc, and its dependencies, such as fctix5 and ibus.
        for Android devices that don't use Gboard, please refer to your device manufacturer's documentation or your keyboard's documentation for adding a Japanese keyboard layout.
        for other OSes, please refer to the OS developer's documentation for installing a Japanese-capable IME.</p>
    <br>
    <p>once you have a Japanese input method ready, type the displayed character into the box and press ENTER to confirm.
        your answers will appear in the dropdown below the input box, with correct answers highlighted in green and incorrect answers highlighted in red.
        incorrect answers will display the way to type the character in romaji next to them.
        some characters such as づ (dzu) will have paranthesis to the right of them, indicating how they are pronounced.
    </p>
    <h2>customization</h2>
    <p>you can customize which kana sets appear in the game by expanding the "Kana sets" dropdown and checking or unchecking the boxes.
        by default, only single-character hiragana is enabled.
        you can enable two-character hiragana, single-character katakana, two-character katakana, and three-character katakana as well.
        feel free to mix and match the sets to your liking!</p>
    <h2>Possibly Asked Questions (PAQ)</h2>
    <h3>Q: why isn't (character nobody's used since ww2) in kana run?</h3>
    <p>A: kana run is a learning tool that focuses on the kana characters used in contemporary Japanese.
        some characters such as ゐ (wi) and ゑ (we) are considered obsolete and are rarely used in modern Japanese writing.
        therefore, they are not included in the kana sets.
